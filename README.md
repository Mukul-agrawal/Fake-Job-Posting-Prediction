# Fake-Job-Posting-Prediction
About the Project: We see a daily rise in these fake job postings where the posting seems pretty reasonable, often these companies will have a website as well, and they will have a recruitment process that is similar to other companies in the industry. If one looks hard enough, they can spot the differences between these fake postings and genuine ones. In this project a machine learning approach is applied which employs a classification algorithms for recognizing fake posts. In this case, a classification tool isolates fake job posts from a larger set of job advertisements and alerts the user.

# Prediction
We have compared machine learning algorithm. We use the algorithm which give the best accuracy.

# Instructions to Execute 
1. Use Spyder(Anaconda) software to run this program.
2. run the file  Fake-Job-Post-Prediction.py
3. Then load the dataset fake_job_postings in Fake-Job-Post-Prediction.py file and run the program.
4. You will see a GUI.
5. In the interface you will have to fill all the required details related job post.
